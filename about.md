### The Person behind the Garden
Welcome. I'm Antonio. This site is a collection of things I find important and interesting, from the complexities of global power shifts to the simplicity of a good viby track.

### Why this blog exists
In a world of algorithmic feeds, I wanted a place of my own, that I own. 
* **Geopolitics:** My attempt to make sense of a changing world.
* **Music:** A curation of sounds that define my weeks.
* **Quotes:** Daily reminders from people wiser than me.
